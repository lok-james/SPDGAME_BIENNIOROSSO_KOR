= Agricultural Policy

With control of the Agricultural Ministry in the hands of the PSI, it seems there is much work to be done in regards to reform. Many in the party are calling for land seizures, and some of our rural voters are requesting aid and financing to help in relieving their economic burden. What do we do?

We are able to seize land form large estate, mostly uncultivated land and hand them out to peasants and veteran-run cooperatives, reducing unemployment.

[? if ldr_promise_failed : Unfortunately, our land seizure has led us to break our agreement with the Liberals, and their representatives have already requested a meeting with us. ?]

We have increased financial support for small farmers, providing aid through credit and insurance. The left and maximalists are unsurprisingly opposed to our policies, seeing them as handouts to petite-bourgeois farmers.

[? if ldr_promise_failed : Unfortunately, increasing funding has led us to enter a deficit, breaking our agreement with the Liberals, and their representatives have already requested a meeting with us. ?]
