= March on Rome

[+ pnf_leader +], alongside his militants, have marched upon Rome, demanding the resignation of the current government. The party is in crisis, as factions scramble to assemble a coherent response to the threat. [? if centre_left_coalition or left_wing_coalition or socialist_catholic_coalition : Our coalition partners not responded to [+ pnf_leader +]'s demands, as frantic calls are made to them to organise meetings. ?][? if king_relation < 50 : The King has not responded to the demands as well, but we are pessimistic on his response, considering our strained relations. ?][? if king_relation > 49 : The King has not responded to the demands as well, but we are optimistic on his response, considering our warm relations. ?]

[? if psi_in_government : We could utilise our government influence to bring down [+ pnf_leader +] and fascism once and for all. ?][if not_participating = 1 : We cannot rely on the bourgeois parties to defend this nation from fascism. ?] What do we do?

Our forces have engaged in fierce combat with the Fasci, Arditismo and Anti-Bolshevik Leagues.

Whatever the case, our initial force has been defeated and forced to retreat, as [+ pnf_leader +] threatens further violence to bring 'order' to the Kingdom. Violence and blood is painted on the streets of Rome, as men across Italy are ordered to take up arms, either in defence of the Kingdom against fascism or socialism.

What happens now?

It seems the March on Rome has erupted into chaos, as forces across the nation take up arms, pledging support to one side or the other. 

We are in a long, protracted war with the fascists now. This will be sure to shape our future immensely. Time will only tell how.

Our forces easily overwhelm [+ pnf_leader +]'s, as the Fasci are routed and forced to retreat. 

Victory is achieved, and fascism is staved off for yet another day.
