= Military Demobilisation to Continue

The Military is to continue its demobilisation of its forces back to post-war levels. It does so in waves, and this month seems to be the latest one. Though a strain on already high unemployment, this is sure to relieve the budget by a substantial amount.

We successfully persuade the army to delay the mobilisation by another 6 months, letting us continue our policies without the extra burden of more unemployed soldiers. Keeping the army that big isn't cheap, either.

We are able to convince the army to end its demobilisation, the budget will be balanced some other way. Many in the party decry our seemingly pro-war stance, however.
