= Military Demobilisation to Continue

The Military is to continue its demobilisation of its forces back to post-war levels. It does so in waves, and this month seems to be the latest one. Though a strain on already high unemployment, this is sure to relieve the budget by a substantial amount.

- @delay_demobilise: Influence the army to delay the orders.
- @stop_demobilise: Influence the army to end demobilisation.

subtitle: -1 Budget - Further unemployment would only make matters worse.

on-arrival: demobilise_timer += 6; demobilised_delay = 1; budget -= 1

We successfully persuade the army to delay the mobilisation by another 6 months, letting us continue our policies without the extra burden of more unemployed soldiers. Keeping the army that big isn't cheap, either.

on-arrival: stopped_mobilisation = 1; budget -= 7 if army_strength > 3000; budget -= 5 if army_strength > 2000 and army_strength < 3000; budget -= 3 if army_strength < 2000 and army_strength > 1000; dissent += 0.1;

We are able to convince the army to end its demobilisation, the budget will be balanced some other way. Many in the party decry our seemingly pro-war stance, however.

choose-if: para_resources > 0
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough paramilitary resources. (Need 1).

We are able to utilise our resources to recruit and bolster our own forces, as the fascists do the same.

subtitle: +1 Budget
on-arrival: army_strength -= 692; unemployment += 1.9; budget += 1; demobilise_timer += 6; fdc_strength += 15; ard_strength += 10; abl_strength += 5; veterans += 2;

The Regio Esercito continues its post-war demobilisation, as the fascists utilise the opportunity to bolster their ranks.
