= Price Control Measures

The Nitti government has floored a bill that would abolish price controls on essential goods, including a controversial abolishing of price controls on bread. Our support base, allies and the vast majority of our leadership has demanded we vote against the bill, as a general strike has seemingly begun once more in response to this.

What should we do?

- @vote_yes: Vote yes, abolishing the price controls on bread.
- @vote_no: Vote no, against abolishing the price controls on bread.
- @abstain: Abstain from the vote.

Our grassroots party members are shocked by our intransigence! Many party branches have begun agitating against the cabinet, and our own delegation members even plan a full vote on the proposal, contravening the government's decision.

The workers view this as betrayal, as do the unions. The bill is voted down anyways by a slight margin in fear of the ongoing general strike. The coalition government does not seem that it will last, but it unclear if we will benefit following our betrayal.

Regardless of our vote, the bill is voted down a significant measure in fear of the ongoing general strike. The coalition government does not seem that it will last.
