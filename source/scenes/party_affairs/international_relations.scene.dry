#subtitle: Building ties with our fraternal socialist parties.

= Comintern Relations

At the Labour and Socialist International, we can forge contacts with our fraternal socialist parties in Europe and across the world.

- @fr_uk: Build relationships with the French SFIO and British Labour Party to keep their governments aligned with Italy.
- @germany: Learn organisation and street fighting from the German communists.
- @comintern: Expand our contacts and influence with the Soviets through the Comintern.
- @papacy: Expand our contacts with the Papacy utilising our influence within the PPI.
- @america: Contact the Socialist party of America.
- @hungary: Send aid to the Party of Communists in Hungary.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.

The socialists of France and Britain can influence their governments to be friendlier towards Italy.

[? if violent_revolution : We are able to delay any plans that have towards us, as well. ?]

Germany is in turmoil. With memories of the Spartacist Uprising still fresh, and the Spartacus League higher command under threat from right-wing forces, we can offer them refuge, welcoming them as exiles to Italy and training our forces with their experience in the Spartakusbund.

Our efforts are welcomed by the Soviets, and [? if not rcw_over :we aid them in their civil war against the White Army. ?][? if rcw_over :we aid them in their post-war recovery. ?]

[? if soviet_leader = "Trotsky" : Secretary-General Trotsky sends us military equipment to arm the Red Guards in response. ?]

on-arrival: papal_relation += 1; ppi_relation -= 10; resources -= 2; 

We utilise our influence within the PPI to expand our contact amongst the PPI. We notice an increase in attitude with the Holy See.

on-arrival: resources -= 1; supported_usa += 1;

The Socialist Party of America is tiny and has limited support, especially following their loss in the recent elections. There is not much we can do for them, and conversely, not much they can do for us.

The Hungarian Communists are in an opportune time to seize power, and we can only hope our aid helps them spread the cause further.
