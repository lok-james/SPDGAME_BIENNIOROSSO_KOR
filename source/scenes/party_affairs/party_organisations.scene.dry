= Party Organisations

In addition to being a political party, the PSI is a social world onto itself, with a vast array of associated organisations which serve the social needs of their members from cradle to grave.

- @newspapers: Fund more newspapers and journalists.
- @welfare: Fund more mutual aid and welfare programs.
- @culture: Fund sports leagues, educational, and cultural programs.
- @rg: Fund the Red Guards, our paramilitary organisation.
- @nothing: Do not increase funding for any program.

We have increased funding to *Unione Nazionale fra Militari Cattolici Mutilati, Invalidi e Reduci di Guerra*, our veterans welfare organisation.

It is not enough for the PSI to solely be a political party. Our schools, libraries, cultural events and initiatives are crucial to our members' lives. Funding these organisations makes our members more committed to the party, even when our policies might not be to their liking.
